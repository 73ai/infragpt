# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is the InfraGPT marketing website built with Astro 5, a modern static site generator. The site serves as the public-facing website for the InfraGPT platform - an AI SRE copilot for cloud infrastructure management.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev         # Start development server with host binding
npm run start      # Alternative dev command (astro dev only)

# Build and preview
npm run build      # Build for production
npm run preview    # Preview production build locally

# Direct Astro CLI access
npm run astro      # Run Astro CLI commands
```

## Architecture Overview

### Framework Stack
- **Astro 5**: Static site generator with island architecture
- **Alpine.js**: Lightweight reactive framework for interactivity

- **Type-safe schema**: Content validation via Zod schemas in `src/content/config.ts`
- **Markdown processing**: Enhanced with rehype plugins for autolinked headings

### Key Features
- **PWA Support**: Progressive Web App capabilities via @vite-pwa/astro
- **SEO Optimization**: Meta tags, sitemaps, and OpenGraph integration
- **Internationalization**: Multi-language blog content structure
- **Performance**: Content visibility optimizations and view transitions

- `@pages/*` → `src/pages/*`

## Styling and Design

- **Primary Color**: `#0023C4` (defined in tailwind.config.cjs)
- **Typography**: Inter Variable font for sans-serif text
- **Components**: Custom components built with Astro and styled with Tailwind
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind utilities

## Content Creation

Blog posts follow this frontmatter schema:
```yaml
draft: boolean
title: string
snippet: string
image:
  src: string
  alt: string
publishDate: string (ISO format)
author: string (defaults to "YourCompany")
category: string
tags: string[]
```

## Build Configuration

- **Site URL**: https://infragpt.io
- **Output**: Static site generation
- **PWA**: Configured with auto-update registration
- **Markdown**: Enhanced with slug generation and autolinked headings

## Recent Development Learnings

### Security & Dependency Management
- **Vulnerability Resolution**: Resolved CVE-2025-5889 (ReDoS) in brace-expansion package
  - Used `npm update brace-expansion` to update from vulnerable 2.0.1 to secure 2.0.2
  - Verified fix with `npm audit` showing 0 vulnerabilities
  - Targeted updates more effective than removing package-lock.json for security patches

### GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline
- **Automated Deployment**: Configured GitHub Actions for Netlify deployment
- **Build Process**: Astro build → Netlify deployment on main branch pushes
- **Dependency Caching**: npm cache optimization for faster CI builds

### Website Enhancement Features
- **Development Status Indicator**: Added visual indicator in hero section showing project status
- **Vision Page**: Created dedicated `/vision` page with compelling content copy
- **Navigation Updates**: Enhanced navbar with Vision link and improved responsive design
- **Mobile Optimization**: Ensured responsive design across all new components

### Security Best Practices
- **Commit Message Standards**: Security fixes should include CVE references and detailed descriptions
- **Dependabot Integration**: Proactive monitoring and resolution of security alerts
- **Version Pinning**: Careful management of dependency versions in package-lock.json
